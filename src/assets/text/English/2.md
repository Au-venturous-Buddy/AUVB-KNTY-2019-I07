Located right beside (and is physically connected to) a BreadTalk bakery branch at SM Aura, NANYANG almost looks like a typical Singaporean coffee shop with a modern touch. You would be amazed at the intrinsic tile art that adorns the cafe, and upon ordering, you can even take a peek at how the baristas prepare the kopi (coffee) and teh (tea)!
